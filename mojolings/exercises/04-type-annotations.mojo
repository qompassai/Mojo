# I'M NOT DONE

#
# Core Concept:
#
#   Mojo supports (and encourages) type annoations when declaring variables.
#   This "can make your code more predictable, manageable, and secure" (docs).
#
#   In this exercise, you will work backwards, and use the function signature
#   to determine the correct type to assign to the three variables.

fn print_student_info(name: String, age: Int, gpa: Float16):
    print('Name: ' + name + ', Age: ' + age + ', GPA: ' + gpa)
